 TRC_malleson_mission_desc:0 "Initially sent into Transcaspia to aid the Ashkhabad Comittee as well as to deter German and Turkish military activity, the Malleson Mission, headed by General Wilfrid Malleson, is a British Expeditionary Force of approximately 1000 troops currently aiding the Transcapian Government. Already having faced, and defeated the forces of the Tashkent Soviet, the General proceeded to push further, defeating the Bolsheviks at the Battle of Dushak, inflicting close to 1000 casualties.\n\nNow however, with the Transcapian Government finding a new patron in General Denikin's Southern Army, the force has begun a retreat from the area, with only a few token troops left near the frontlines. Nonetheless, the military advice of Malleson and his lieutenants has proven a great asset to the Government, even if it has resulted in discontent amongst some members of the government.\n\n§YShould you wish to retain control of the British Forces, you will need to act fast to secure their favour.§!"
